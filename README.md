Adding Discord Rich Presence to Blender

Based on [python-discord-rpc](https://github.com/suclearnub/python-discord-rpc) by [subclearnub](https://github.com/suclearnub).
Actually working version of AlexApps99's version. Found in left panels misc section. If anyone knows how to get it to update itself regularly without needing a hotkey/button, feel free to help out with the project.
